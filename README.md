This repository is intended to be used with the Binder service.
Please click the image below: if all is well the link should redirect
to a new binder image running a Jupyter notebook server.

Once the binder is launched, click on "Irf1KO_BatfKO_Tr1_networks.ipynb".  The iPython 
notebook will open in a new tab.  Then, to visualize networks:
1. Select "Cell" and then click "Run All"
2. Draft Documentation for this tool can be found here:
